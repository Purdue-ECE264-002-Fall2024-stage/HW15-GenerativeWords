The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty:  as it waned into
dusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from
Gateshead:  we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed;
great grey hills heaved up round the horizon:  as twilight deepened,
we descended a valley, dark with wood, and long after night had
overclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.

Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was
open, and a person like a servant was standing at it:  I saw her
face and dress by the light of the lamps.

"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?"  she asked.  I
answered "Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down,
and the coach instantly drove away.
